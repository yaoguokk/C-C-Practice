Description: This task contains 4 subtask. They are following:
Problem1a:Given an input file (of strings). Reads the file into c++ strings. Assume each input file has only one line of maximum 10 strings. Then print them out on screen.
Problem1b: It prints the strings in the input file into an output file, but with reverse order of strings. 
Problem1c: It prints the strings into out1c.txt in a lexicographical order.
Problem2:Given a C++ string S2 of numbers, and an integer K, fed via cin, write a C++ code that adds K  ":" symbols in between the characters (i.e., numbers) in every possible way and prints them into a file out2.txt. Note that every two consecutive ":" symbols should have at least one digit between them, and also cannot appear at the beginning or end of the string. It should also print the maximum number between each two ":" symbols

Thanks to  "Simple Simple", I refer his code "optimized bubble sort" to finish the string in terms of lexicographical order.

Thanks to "Snail_cz", when I have no idea how to choose n items among m items , which is Permutations. His code gives me hint. So that I could keep going. Thanks again.
