Description: 

For the first part, file generating,it will generate a file every 5 seconds. 
Need to generate 20 such files. The first line of each file should have a topic name which is selected randomly from these 4 available options: INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL.  The second line of each file should have a random number generated between 1 and 1000 which represents the error type index. The files should be named as “logfile-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt”.
